PROMPT="summarize: In today’s Q3 planning meeting, the team discussed improving both technical reliability and user experience for our mobile payment solution. Engineering proposed migrating parts of the backend to microservices to boost scalability and adding real-time fraud detection using machine learning. The design team emphasized faster checkout flows and suggested reducing confirmation steps. They also recommended adding biometric authentication options like Face ID and fingerprint login. Marketing highlighted that smoother payments drive retention and customer satisfaction. The group agreed that technical upgrades and UX enhancements should move forward in parallel, with coordination across engineering, design, and marketing."
